I'm going to use natural language to define tables and relationships that we will use to create models that will then be implemented on my PostgreSQL database.

Assume that I always want an autoincremental column in my tables even if I forget to specify that! If the data type is not obvious, please assume that I want it to be text. If I specify that a column will involve storing numbers, please assume that I wish to store whole numbers without decimal places.

I may sometimes specify the data type using paratheses. For example if I say created_at (date) that means that it should be a column with the name created_at and with the PostgreSQL format of date.

I'll define tables in natural language. Please attempt to set up the corresponding M2M and M20 relationships.

Now I'll define the data structure:

Create a table called promptoutputs with fields for:

summary
output_text
created_at (date)
output_edited
output_notes

Create a table called customgpts with fields for:

summary
gptname
creation_date (date)
use_case
known_limitations
gpt_notes


Create a table called promptlibrary with fields for:

promptshort
prompt_fulltext
prompt_description
prompt_usecase

Create a table called lookup_accuracylevels with fields for
level_name
level_description

Create M2M relationships between customgpts, promptlibrary, promptoutputs and this table

Create a table called lookup_actionability with fields for
actionability_level
actionability_description

Each row in prompptoutputs can have one value in this table, but eacn value in this table can be associated with many values in promptoutputs


Create a table called lookup_automationlevels with fields for
level
description

Create an M2M between this table and customgpts

Create a table called lookup_backupstatuses with fields for
statusname
status_desc

Each value in custom GPTs, prompt library and prompt outputs can be associated with one of these values (but each value in the table can be associated with many in the corresponding tables)

Create a table called lookup_creationaccount with fields
accountname
account_desc
Each custom GPT can be associated with one of these values. But each value can be associated with many custom GPTs.

Create a table called lookup_gpt_groups
An m2m exists between this table and custom GPTs.

create a table called lookup_dataretentionplans with fields
retentionplan
plan_desc

Create an M2M relationship between this table and custom GPTs. Create an M2M relationship between this table and prompt outputs.


Create a table called lookup_followupactivities with fields
activityname
activitydesc

Create M2M relationships between this table and each of the following:
Custom GPTs
Prompt library
Prompt outputs

Create a table called lookup_tags with these fields:
tag_name
tag_desc
created_at

Create M2M relationships between this table and each of:
Custom GPTs
Prompt library
Prompt outputs

Create a table called lookup_gpt_tasks with values
task_name
task_desc

Create M2M relationships between this value and the custom GPTs table.

Create a table called lookup_gpt_capabilities with values for
capability_name
capability_desc

Create M2M relationships between this table and the custom GPTs table. Create another one between this table and the prompt outputs table.


Creaate a table called lookup_llm_models with values for
model_name
model_desc
release_date

Create M2M relationships between this table and each of the following:
Custom GPTs
Prompt library
Prompt outputs


Create a table called lookup_categories with values
cat_name
cat_desc
created_at


Create M2M relationships between this table and each of the following:
Custom GPTs
Prompt library
Prompt outputs

Create a table called lookup_knowledge_types with values for:
name
description

Create M2M relationships between this table and the custom GPTs table and the prompt outputs table.

Create a lookup table called lookup_projects with fields for
projectname
project_desc
projectstart (date)
projectned (date)

Create M2M relationships between this table and each of the following:
Custom GPTs
Prompt library
Prompt outputs

Create a lookup table called lookup_status with values for
status_name
status_desc
Each prompt output and each custom GPT and each prompt library entry can have one of these (but each status can have many corresponding values)


Create a table called lookup_programming_languages with values for
lang_name
lang_desc


Create M2M relationships between this table and each of the following:
Custom GPTs
Prompt library
Prompt outputs

Create a table called lookup_human_languages with values for
lang_name
lang_desc
Create M2M relationships between this table and each of the following:
Custom GPTs
Prompt library
Prompt outputs

Create a table called lookup_urgency with values for
urgency_level
status_desc

Each prompt output can have one of these but each value in this table can be associated with many prompt outputs


Create a table called lookup_worldcountries with values for
countryname
continent

Create M2M relationships between this table and each of the following:
Custom GPTs
Prompt library
Prompt outputs

Create a table called lookup_usecases with values for
usecase_name
usecase_desc
Create M2M relationships between this table and each of the following:
Custom GPTs
Prompt library
Prompt outputs

Create a table called lookup_prompteng_techniques with values for
tech_name
tech_desc
Create M2M relationships between this table and each of the following:
Custom GPTs
Prompt library
Prompt outputs

Create a table called lookup_compliance_standards
Each prompt output, custom GPT, and prompt library entry has one value in this table. But each value in this table can have many in the corresponding tables.
